# PHSX815_Week5
Contains the homework code for week 5


HW 5:
This code was adapted from prof Rogan's week 5 repository: https://github.com/crogan/PHSX815_Week5 
To run this code put the Random.py code in a separate folder and specify the folder name in the RejectSamp.py code, so the code knows where to find Random.py

Next simply run: python3 RejectSamp.py 
You can use the -Nsample tag to alter the sample size
This code will preform the rejection sampling analysis to estimate the density of our semi-circle (f(x)) using a flat line(g(x)) then it should output a plot of the resulting histogram with f(x) and g(x).

I have provided two output plots for -Nsample 100 and -Nsample 10000 in this repository.
